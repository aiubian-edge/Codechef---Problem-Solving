// Problem
// Harsh was recently gifted a book consisting of NN pages. Each page contains exactly MM words printed on it. As he was bored, he decided to count the number of words in the book.

// Help Harsh find the total number of words in the book.

// Input Format
// The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
// Each test case consists of two space-separated integers on a single line, NN and MM â€” the number of pages and the number of words on each page, respectively.
// Output Format
// For each test case, output on a new line, the total number of words in the book.
