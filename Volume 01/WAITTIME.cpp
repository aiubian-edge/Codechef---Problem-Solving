// Problem
// Chef is eagerly waiting for a piece of information. His secret agent told him that this information would be revealed to him after KK weeks.

// XX days have already passed and Chef is getting restless now. Find the number of remaining days Chef has to wait for, to get the information.

// It is guaranteed that the information has not been revealed to the Chef yet.

// Input Format
// The first line of input will contain an integer TT â€” the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows.
// The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers KK and XX, as described in the problem statement.
// Output Format
// For each test case, output the number of remaining days that Chef will have to wait for.
